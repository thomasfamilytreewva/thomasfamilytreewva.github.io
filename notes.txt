Good progress on automating myObj/pngFiles.
After any changes to the sqlDb manually or thru CRUD the following must happen.
1. From adminMenu.html I must run sqlJson which exports testtable into
the $myObj variable, then saves the $myObj variable as jsonMyObj.txt file.
2. I then run index.html which creates myObj from the jsonMyObj.txt file, 
deletes the old local storage myObj and creates new myObj.
3. Then the updated myObj variable is available for both searchfamilymember.html
and whodat.html

The problem I'm now having is that I have to run index.html with Google console
(Function f12) open to get the myObj to update with the new data.
Problem happens because index.html was opening the admin.php in a new window.
Solution - Have index.html open admin.php is same window.

localstorage index.html the old storage file must first be deleted.

Cannot fully automate pngFiles and the myObj process.
For now I will use their respective PHP pages 
(adminImages.php and adminSqlJson.php)
and copy the results into the variable declaration in the <script>
section of the index.html file.<script> 
The same <script> will then put the variables in localstorage.
This way both variables will be available throughout the program
on all computers, domains and devices after uploading to Github.

Github does not support anything php related. (files, pages, scripts).

html js php thoughts
I can run js in html page but I cannot run php in html page because 
php can only be processed from a php page. If I want to run html and
php together I must run it from a php  page.
***the big question is - "should I use php pages so I can use html js and php?"
The answer is yes if I'm working on a server that supports php but 
most free hosting sites use servers that do not support php.
***When I'm testing on my localhost server I have php support so 
I will do my php work (ex:iterate directory) and pass the final info to
my html page via js. I hope it works.

000Webhost.com archived my Website around Oct 2019. They will only
unarchive it if I open a paid premium account. So I am attempting to convert
all of the php/mysql code to javascript.

To use the program after these conversions I must
1. Update my localhost sql database with any new family info.
2. Export the testtable as a json file.
3. Edit the json file by opening and deleting the headers resulting in an array [{...}]
4. Copy and paste the edited file into index.html

/*
This is how to echo a html form using php. 
It seems to be you must use " quotation marks outside 
and ' single quotation marks inside
echo "<form action='myPhpFunctions.php' method='POST'>"; 
echo  "First Name:<input type='text' name='FirstNameEcho' value='$FirstName'/>"; 
echo  "Last Name:<input type='text' name='LastNameEcho' value='$LastName'/>";

From html I cannot call a php function in another php file. 

I think all the php functions run automatically when a page is loaded.

I can call a specific php function from another php function file thru
a javascript function. See index.php
Must have the php file included in index.php using
<?php include("myPhpFunctions.php"); ?>

The javascript function that calls the php function must be located in 
the head of the index.php file.
function callPhp1(){
	var result="<?php php1();?>";
	alert (result);
}

I can call a specific JS function on another page (myJsFunctions.js) but 
I must have script src in head of index.php
<script src="myJsFunctions.js"></script>




  UID and Descendant number is counted from 1... starting with Chaney number 1
and Grandpa number 15. The number progresses from top to bottom left to right.

When manually adding or deleting a family member in function populateDummyData
(main.js) the UID/Descendant number will change for all members downstream from
from the added/deleted family member and the family tree diagram will display
erroneous relationships.
Solution:
Create and MSExcel Sub DescendantUpdate
If family member is deleted all downstream family members DescendantNumber will 
be decreased by 1.
If family member is added all downstream family members DescendantNumber will 
be increased by 1.



When adding a new family member in function populateDummyData (main.js)
all node user ids (UID) of the newly added member and all node user ids (UID)
a number higher than the newly added UID no longer match the UID of the
SQL Database. The UID increases by the number of new family members 
added in function populateDummyData.

For example
Taj original UID in both the Family Tree and Database is 122.
I then add 1 new family member (Constance) Cynthia's daughter.
Contance new UID is 122 as assigned by the Java Code.
All Old UID starting at 122 are now increased by 1.
Taj original UID 122 now becomes 123.
UID 123 becomes 124 
And so forth until the last UID.

Solution: Create a function which updates the SQL Database 
with the same UID as the function getIDandName of function initialize in
main.js

The new function MatchUidJavaSql()
Var NewUID = UID of new family member.
Var NumberNewFamilyMembersAdded
Sort SQL table by UID high to low.
Loop thru each UID until UID = NewUID
UID = UID + Number of new family members added.

function populateDummyData(tree) --- This creates Chaney
tree.addChild(TREE.create("Sally")); --- This adds Chaney's children.
         It's repeated for each of Chaney's children.
//William Thomas family Grandpa's father
tree.getChildAt() is counted from 0.... starting with Sally
	tree.getChildAt(3).addChild(TREE.create("John"));

	//Grandpa Joe Thomas family 
	tree.getDescendent() is counted from 1... starting with Chaney number 1
	        and Grandpa number 15
  tree.getDescendent(15).addChild(TREE.create("Gladys"));
